For my design choice, I looked around the internet for simplistic and clean looking portfolios for inspiration. 
I found some indie and obscure sites that looked really good in my opinion

Most of the images are/is me and made by me. The projects are just reused github pages I did

I have a domain that I hope to use some time in the future for web hosting


---- Problems ----
I had a hard time with adding grid cards to the page. It was kind of confusing until I watched this tutorial on how to make grids look more presentable 
I had some ideas based on the hero, I had to learn how to make a hero and spacing it 
the site looked weird on mobile then I forgot that I had to add align-items-center on some items
